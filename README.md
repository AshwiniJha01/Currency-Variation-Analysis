# Currency-Variation-Analysis
This repository explore the variation of different countries' currency vs USD.

The idea I want to test is if all the currencies react to changes in USD in the same manner or some currencies react differently. I believe if I build a linear regression model where I model the value of a currency in USD on the Gold value in USD, the coefficients and the std error in the coefficients can indicate the reaction behavior. If the std error in the coefficients is high, it would mean higher unpredictability on a currency's value when based on USD. Also, the error in the model for a given currency, when significantly different from other currencies can imply that currency is not directly linked to USD exchange rate, which would not be natural as USD is an index of a currency's strength. The idea to choose Gold value in USD as the explanatory variable is that gold's exchange value in USD reflects the USD's value. Hence, when we model a currency's exchange rate in USD on Gold value in USD, we are essentially explaining variation in a currency's value based on variation in US currency (and maybe account for country's inhererent inflation as well this way)
